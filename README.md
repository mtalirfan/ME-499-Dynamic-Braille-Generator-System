# ME-499-Dynamic-Braille-Generator-System

ME-499 Final Year Project: Dynamic Braille Generator System

Design and development of a machine capable of dynamically generating Braille for persons with visual disability.

## Project Description

The project aims to design and develop a machine capable of dynamically generating Braille for persons with visual disability. The machine will be able to generate Braille characters in real-time based on the input provided by the user. The machine will consist of Braille cells that can be actuated to form different characters. The user will be able to input text using a keyboard or other input device, and the machine will convert the text into Braille characters. The machine will be able to generate Braille characters and will be able to display the characters on a screen or other output device.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Design and develop a machine capable of dynamically generating Braille for persons with visual disability.

2. Implement a user interface for inputting text and controlling the machine.

3. Develop a software program to convert text input into Braille characters.

4. Test the machine and software program to ensure that they are functioning correctly.

## Project Deliverables

The project deliverables will include the following:

1. A fully functional machine capable of dynamically generating Braille characters.

2. A user interface for inputting text and controlling the machine.

3. A software program to convert text input into Braille characters.

4. Test results and documentation of the project.

## Project Timeline

The project timeline is as follows:

- Week 1-2: Project planning and research

- Week 3-4: Machine design and development

- Week 5-6: User interface development

- Week 7-8: Software program development

- Week 9-10: Testing and documentation
